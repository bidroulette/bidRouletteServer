## Bid Roulette  

Our server is a hosting service for auctions. Clients can bid on the various items up for auction and the highest bid is saved to our database for later use.



## UML

This is an early version of our UML: ![UML](/images/bidRouletteUML.PNG)

We originally planned to build this application as a serverless service on AWS, and it may migrate to that architecture in the future. 

Our final UML is closer to this hybrid UML
